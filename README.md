# Infromation-Retrieval-using-LLM
This project presents a user-friendly, multi-document question-answering system designed to help students easily retrieve syllabus and course-related information from large academic document collections. By combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with advanced language models like Ollama and Phi-3, and utilizing ChromaDB for efficient database management, the system delivers precise and relevant answers to complex academic queries. Integrated with a simple Streamlit interface, it allows users to ask questions and receive accurate responses in real-time, making syllabus retrieval faster and more accessible. Rigorous testing shows the system's significant improvements in speed and accuracy over traditional methods, enhancing the learning experience by making course information easily accessible.
